# fp-in-scala-exercises
Repo to keep (and share) my solutions of the "Functional Programming In Scala" book exercises.

Each exercise extends App so it can be run separately and has a last call to print as a side effect to make the run prettier. Use `sbt runMain Chapter<N>.Exercise<N>` or just ```sbt run``` and choose the exercise to run

Some exercises have tests implemented.
