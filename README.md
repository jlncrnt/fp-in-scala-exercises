# fp-in-scala-exercises
Repo to keep (and share) my solutions to the exercises in "Functional Programming In Scala"

Each exercise extends App so it can be run separately and has a last call to print as a side effect to make the run prettier. Use `run-main Chapter<N>.Exercise<N>`.

Please be advised that I have not compared all of my answers to the official answers repo (https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala).
